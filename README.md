# ALWeb-Dev-Proj
Austin Lane Tech. Web Developer test project.

## Description
The goal of this project is to be able to create a list of users and display a table with the already existing users.

## Getting started
This project is pretty bare bones, so any simple IDE/Text Editor will work.

It is recommended to use the [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to see your changes
in real time.

## Requirements
- When the user clicks submit, create a `User` data object found in `index.js`. The username field is required,
so if not given, alert the user until the value is present.

- After the user has been created, the results need to be shown in the section `.existing-users-area`. Since this 
`User` object accepts three parameters, your table needs to have the three respective columns.

- In terms of CRUD operations, users can be created or deleted. Do not worry about updating existing data.
- 
- Since you will not create a database, your list of users will be kept in memory (i.e. array) and should match what is on the screen.

## Tech Requirements
- All your javascript needs to be contained in `index.js`, and css in `index.css`.
  
- You do not have to use any specific javascript library or framework.
  
- You will be required to explain your code.

When completed bundle your project via `.zip`.
